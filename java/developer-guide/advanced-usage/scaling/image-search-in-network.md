To run a reverse image search, use the [searchFirst](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/java/com.groupdocs.search.scaling/searcher/#searchFirst-com.groupdocs.search.common.SearchImage-com.groupdocs.search.options.ImageSearchOptions-) method of the [Searcher](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/java/com.groupdocs.search.scaling/searcher/) class. This method returns the first portion of results.

To continue the search, the [searchNext](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/java/com.groupdocs.search.scaling/searcher/#searchNext-com.groupdocs.search.scaling.results.NetworkImageSearchToken-) method is used, returning the second and subsequent portions of results.

The search image object and search options object are the same as those used for single index searches.

The following code example demonstrates performing a reverse image search on the search network.

```java
System.out.println("First image search");

Searcher searcher = node.getSearcher();
ImageSearchOptions options = new ImageSearchOptions();
options.setHashDifferences(hashDifferences);
int total = 0;

NetworkImageSearchResult result = searcher.searchFirst(searchImage, options);
System.out.println("Images found (shard " + result.getShardIndex() + "): " + result.getImageCount());
total += result.getImageCount();

while (result.getNetworkImageSearchToken() != null) {
    System.out.println();
    System.out.println("Next image search");

    result = searcher.searchNext(result.getNetworkImageSearchToken());
    System.out.println("Images found (shard " + result.getShardIndex() + "): " + result.getImageCount());
    total += result.getImageCount();
}

System.out.println();
System.out.println("Total images found (diffs = " + hashDifferences + "): " + total);
```
