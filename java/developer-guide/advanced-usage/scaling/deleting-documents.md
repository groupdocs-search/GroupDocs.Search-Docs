Documents can be deleted from the search network using the [delete](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/java/com.groupdocs.search.scaling/indexer/#delete-java.lang.String---com.groupdocs.search.options.DeleteOptions-) method of the [Indexer](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/java/com.groupdocs.search.scaling/indexer/) class.

To delete documents, you must pass an array of document keys, as well as a delete options object, to the [delete](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/java/com.groupdocs.search.scaling/indexer/#delete-java.lang.String---com.groupdocs.search.options.DeleteOptions-) method of the [Indexer](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/java/com.groupdocs.search.scaling/indexer/) class.

An asynchronous delete flag is available as an option. In the case of asynchronous deletion, you can track the completion of the operation by subscribing to the [DeletionCompleted](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/java/com.groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/#DeletionCompleted) event.

The following code example demonstrates how to delete documents from the search network.

```java
System.out.println();
System.out.println("Deleting documents");

String[] fileNames = new String[filePaths.length];
for (int i = 0; i < filePaths.length; i++) {
    String filePath = filePaths[i];
    fileNames[i] = filePath;
}

Indexer indexer = node.getIndexer();

DeleteOptions options = new DeleteOptions();
indexer.delete(fileNames, options);
```
