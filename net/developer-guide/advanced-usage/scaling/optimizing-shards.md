All search network shards can be optimized with a single call the [Optimize](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/indexer/optimize/) method of the [Indexer](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/indexer/) class.

The optimization minimizes the number of index segments on each shard. As a result, search performance increases.

An asynchronous execution flag is available as an option. In the case of asynchronous optimization, you can track the completion of the operation by subscribing to the [OptimizationCompleted](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/optimizationcompleted/) event.

The following code example demonstrates how to perform search network optimization.

**C#**

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Optimizing shards");
Indexer indexer = node.Indexer;
OptimizeOptions options = new OptimizeOptions();
indexer.Optimize(options);
```
