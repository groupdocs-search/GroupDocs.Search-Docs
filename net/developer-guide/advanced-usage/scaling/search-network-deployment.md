The GroupDocs.Search search network consists of one master node and several slave nodes. Each node is a hardware server with the .NET platform deployed on it. Inside the .NET platform, an application is deployed that creates an instance of the [SearchNetworkNode](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/searchnetworknode/) class.

An instance of the [SearchNetworkNode](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/searchnetworknode/) class provides the services described in the configuration:
 - Indexing service;
 - Search services;
 - Extraction services;
 - Shard services.
Indexing and search services also provide an interface to access all search network features.

To deploy the GroupDocs.Search search network, you must perform the following steps:
 - On each slave server, create an instance of the [SearchNetworkNode](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/searchnetworknode/) class, call the Start method.
 - On the master server, create an instance of the [SearchNetworkNode](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/searchnetworknode/) class, passing the configuration object to the constructor.
 - Call the [ConfigureAllNodes](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/searchnetworknode/configureallnodes/) method of the [SearchNetworkNode](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/searchnetworknode/) object on the master server.
 - Call the [Start](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/searchnetworknode/start/) method of the [SearchNetworkNode](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/searchnetworknode/) object on the master server.

The following code example demonstrates starting a slave node on the server.

**C#**

```csharp
SearchNetworkNode node1 = new SearchNetworkNode(
    1,
    basePath + "Node1",
    new TcpSettings(basePort + 1, sendTimeout, receiveTimeout));
node1.Start();
```

The following code example demonstrates starting a master node on the server.

**C#**

```csharp
SearchNetworkNode node0 = new SearchNetworkNode(
    0,
    basePath + "Node0",
    new TcpSettings(basePort, sendTimeout, receiveTimeout),
    new ConsoleLogger(),
    configuration);

node0.Events.ConfigurationCompleted += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Configuration complete");
};

Console.WriteLine();
Console.WriteLine("Configuring the search network");
node0.ConfigureAllNodes();

Console.WriteLine("Launching the search network");
node0.Start();
```

The following code example demonstrates the implementation of a simple console logger.

**C#**

```csharp
class ConsoleLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Error(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Error: " + message);
    }

    public void Trace(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Trace: " + message);
    }
}
```
