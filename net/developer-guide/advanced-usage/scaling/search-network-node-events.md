This page contains information about the purpose and use of all search network events.

## ConfigurationCompleted event

The [ConfigurationCompleted](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/configurationcompleted/) event occurs when the search network configuration process is finished.

## IndexingCompleted event

The [IndexingCompleted](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/indexingcompleted/) event occurs when indexing of all enqueued documents is finished.

## DeletionCompleted event

The [DeletionCompleted](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/deletioncompleted/) event occurs when all enqueued deletions of documents are finished.

## OptimizationCompleted event

The [OptimizationCompleted](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/optimizationcompleted/) event occurs when optimization of all nodes is finished.

## SynchronizationCompleted event

The [SynchronizationCompleted](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/synchronizationcompleted/) event occurs when synchronization with all nodes is finished.

## AttributeChangesCompleted event

The [AttributeChangesCompleted](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/attributechangescompleted/) event occurs when all enqueued attribute changes are finished.

## StatusChanged event

The [StatusChanged](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/statuschanged/) event occurs when the search network status changes.

## DataExtracted event

The [DataExtracted](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/dataextracted/) event occurs when the data has been extracted from a document.

## DocumentIndexed event

The [DocumentIndexed](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/documentindexed/) event occurs when a document has been indexed.

## DocumentDeleted event

The [DocumentDeleted](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/documentdeleted/) event occurs when a document has been deleted.

## ErrorOccurred event

The [ErrorOccurred](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/erroroccurred/) event occurs when an error occurs in one of the nodes of the search network.

## IndexingProgressChanged event

The [IndexingProgressChanged](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/indexingprogresschanged/) event occurs when the progress of the indexing operation has changed.

## OptimizationProgressChanged event

The [OptimizationProgressChanged](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/optimizationprogresschanged/) event occurs when the progress of the optimization operation has changed.

## Code example

**C#**

```csharp
node.Events.IndexingCompleted += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Indexing complete");
};
node.Events.DeletionCompleted += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Deleting complete");
};
node.Events.OptimizationCompleted += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Optimization complete");
};
node.Events.SynchronizationCompleted += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Synchronization complete");
};
node.Events.AttributeChangesCompleted += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Attribute changes complete");
};
node.Events.StatusChanged += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Status changed: " + e.OldStatus + " -> " + e.NewStatus);
};
node.Events.DataExtracted += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Data extracted (" + e.ExtractorIndex + "): " + e.DocumentKey);
};
node.Events.DocumentIndexed += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Document indexed (" + e.ShardIndex + "): " + e.DocumentKey);
};
node.Events.DocumentDeleted += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Document deleted (" + e.ShardIndex + "): " + e.DocumentKey);
};
node.Events.ErrorOccurred += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error occurred (" + e.NodeIndex + ", " + e.ServiceIndex + "): " + e.Message);
};
node.Events.IndexingProgressChanged += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Indexing progress changed (" + e.NodeIndex + ", " + e.ServiceIndex + "): " + e.ProgressPercentage);
};
node.Events.OptimizationProgressChanged += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Optimization progress changed (" + e.NodeIndex + ", " + e.ServiceIndex + "): " + e.ProgressPercentage);
};
```
