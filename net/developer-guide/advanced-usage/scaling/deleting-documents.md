Documents can be deleted from the search network using the [Delete](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/indexer/delete/) method of the [Indexer](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/indexer/) class.

To delete documents, you must pass an array of document keys, as well as a delete options object, to the [Delete](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/indexer/delete/) method of the [Indexer](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/indexer/) method.

An asynchronous delete flag is available as an option. In the case of asynchronous deletion, you can track the completion of the operation by subscribing to the [DeletionCompleted](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/deletioncompleted/) event.

The following code example demonstrates how to delete documents from the search network.

**C#**

```csharp
Console.WriteLine();
Console.WriteLine("Deleting documents");

string[] fileNames = new string[filePaths.Length];
for (int i = 0; i < filePaths.Length; i++)
{
    string filePath = filePaths[i];
    string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
    fileNames[i] = fileName;
}

Indexer indexer = node.Indexer;

DeleteOptions options = new DeleteOptions();
indexer.Delete(fileNames, options);
```
