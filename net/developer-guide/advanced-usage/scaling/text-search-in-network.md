To run a text search, use the [SearchFirst](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/searcher/searchfirst/#searchfirst_1) method of the [Searcher](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/searcher/) class. This method returns the first portion of results.

To continue the search, the [SearchNext](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/searcher/searchnext/) method is used, returning the second and subsequent portions of results.

Currently, only the object form of the search query is supported. The options for a network search are the same as those for a single index search.

The following code example demonstrates performing a full-text search on the search network.

**C#**

```csharp
Searcher searcher = node.Searcher;

SearchQuery query = SearchQuery.CreateWordQuery(word);
Console.WriteLine();
Console.WriteLine("First time search for: " + query);
SearchOptions options = new SearchOptions();
options.IsChunkSearch = true;
options.UseSynonymSearch = useSynonymSearch;
int totalOccurrences = 0;
List<NetworkFoundDocument> documents = new List<NetworkFoundDocument>();

NetworkSearchResult result = searcher.SearchFirst(query, options);

AddDocsFromResult(documents, result);
totalOccurrences += result.OccurrenceCount;
TraceResult(result);

while (result.NextChunkSearchToken != null)
{
    Console.WriteLine();
    Console.WriteLine("Next time search for: " + query);

    result = searcher.SearchNext(result.NextChunkSearchToken);

    AddDocsFromResult(documents, result);
    totalOccurrences += result.OccurrenceCount;
    TraceResult(result);
}

Console.WriteLine();
Console.WriteLine("Total occurrences: " + totalOccurrences);
```
