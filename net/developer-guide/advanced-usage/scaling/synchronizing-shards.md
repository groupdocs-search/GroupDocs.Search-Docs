If there is any communication interruption in the search network, some operations may not complete correctly. To resolve such problems, you need to call the [Synchronize](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/indexer/synchronize/) method of the [Indexer](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling/indexer/) class.

The asynchronous operation flag is available as an option. You can track the completion of the operation by subscribing to the [SynchronizationCompleted](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search.scaling.events/nodeeventhub/synchronizationcompleted/) event.

The following code example demonstrates how to synchronize search network nodes.

**C#**

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Synchronizing shards");
Indexer indexer = node.Indexer;
SynchronizeOptions options = new SynchronizeOptions();
indexer.Synchronize(options);
```
