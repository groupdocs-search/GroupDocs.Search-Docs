This page contains information about index creation methods.

The GroupDocs.Search for .NET search index can be created and stored on disk or entirely in RAM. All changes to the on-disk index are automatically saved and available after it is loaded again. The in-memory index is faster, but uses more RAM and is completely destroyed when you finish working with it.

To create an in-memory index, you must use a constructor that does not have a path to the index folder in its parameter list. The created in-memory index can be converted to an on-disk index using the [SaveTo](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search/index/saveto/) method. This is useful when an in-memory index becomes too large and can no longer reside in RAM alone. After saving to disk, the index can then be loaded from disk as usual. Note that a regular index can be saved to disk in a different folder in the same way. Below is an example of creating an in-memory index and converting it to an on-disk index.

**C#**

```csharp
string indexFolder = @"c:\MyIndex\";
string documentsFolder = @"c:\MyDocuments\";

// Creating an in-memory index
Index index = new Index();

// Indexing documents from the specified folder
index.Add(documentsFolder);

// Saving the index to disk
index.SaveTo(indexFolder);

// Closing the in-memory index
index.Dispose();

// Opening the index from disk
index = new Index(indexFolder);

// Searching in the index
string query = "focus";
SearchResult result = index.Search(query);
```

To create or load an on-disk index, you must pass the path to the index folder through the constructor parameter. The created on-disk index can be converted to an in-memory index using the [LoadIntoMemoryCompletely](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search/index/loadintomemorycompletely/#loadintomemorycompletely) method. After the index is completely loaded into memory, no changes to it are automatically saved to disk. You must explicitly call the [SaveTo](https://reference.groupdocs.com/search/net/groupdocs.search/index/saveto/) method to save any changes to the index. Below is an example of creating an on-disk index and converting it to an in-memory index.

**C#**

```csharp
string indexFolder = @"c:\MyIndex\";
string documentsFolder = @"c:\MyDocuments\";

// Creating a regular index on disk
Index index = new Index(indexFolder);

// Indexing documents from the specified folder
index.Add(documentsFolder);

// Closing the regular index
index.Dispose();

// Loading the index entirely in memory for increased performance
Index inMemoryIndex = Index.LoadIntoMemoryCompletely(indexFolder);

// Searching in the index
string query = "focus";
SearchResult result = inMemoryIndex.Search(query);
```
